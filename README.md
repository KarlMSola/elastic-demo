# elastic-demo
# Internal Elasticsearch demo and workshop, February 2018

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/kms0165/kms/_apis/build/status/KarlMSola.elastic-demo?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/kms0165/kms/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

We borrowed a classroom and filled it with IT Security professionals wanting to learn 
something new and cool about security analytics, dashboarding and visualisation

The servers are all Azure VMs and each student gets one each to play with. The datasets used
are all open and freely available for anyone to use and explore.

Students: After classroom setup is complete, to load ElasticSearch tutorial script into dev console, use the link: http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/dev_tools/console?load_from=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarlMSola/elastic-demo/master/script.txt
